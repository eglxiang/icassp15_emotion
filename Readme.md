Please download the DATA folder (processed Extended Cohn Kanade Database)
from https://goo.gl/Wvfndv (Dropbox) or https://goo.gl/zt89pE (Google Drive)

The program is developed on Windows. Except directory access issues such as '/' or '\', 'ls' or 'dir' and so on, the program should be able to easily migarated to Linux.
